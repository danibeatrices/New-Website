            <p>
                We are a collective of artists formed out of sweden in a wide range of areas from music to photography, 3d-modelling, graphic design, 
                film and clothing design. we do this for the love of it and not with financial gain as a primary goal. the vision and goal is to create an environment 
                where artistic integrity and love for creativity thrives. <br /><br />
                Our current main focus is on music, digital design and hosting events in stockholm featuring our associated acts and artists. 
                These will be a combination of DJ-sets, live performances and displaying both physical and digital art.<br /><br /> 
                We are not a publishing company or any form av record label people sign to. We are a collective and network for creative people with 
                a love for art and good ideals to connect and promote their own and each other's work. we also focus on healthy collaboration between artists 
                in both the same and different fields. we were indeed founded out of love for creating art, but also our disappointment with swedish record labels' 
                and publishing companies' complete refusal to bet on artistic vision instead of products for monetary gain and online engagement. <br /> <br />
                this is our website where you can find updates for events, see our associated artists and acts. you can even see portfolios of the art we create and promote
                and buy clothing/merchandise. you are also able to contact us through the "contact" page. <br /> <br />
                Even though we welcome anyone from anywhere in the world that we deem fit for the purpose of our collective, our current main focus is on queer, 
                female and/or non-binary creators to nourish a safe space for our creative endevours.  <br /><br />
                We do this for the love of it!</p>
